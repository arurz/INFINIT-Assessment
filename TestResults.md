# Test Results and Benchmark Analysis

## Unit Test Results

The application has undergone thorough testing using **XUnit** to ensure its stability and correctness. The tests include:  

1. **Validation of Letter Frequency Count Logic**  
   - Confirmed the accuracy of the `LetterFrequencyCounter` by comparing the output dictionary against expected values for a given set of input files.  

2. **File Retrieval and Filtering**  
   - Tested the functionality that fetches all files from a GitHub repository and ensures only JavaScript and TypeScript files are correctly filtered and returned.  
  
## Benchmark Analysis

The `BenchmarkDotNet` library was used to evaluate the performance of two approaches for counting letter frequencies in files:

1. **Sequential Processing**  - CountLetterFrequenciesWithoutConcurrency - method
2. **Parallel Processing**  - CountLetterFrequencies method

### Key Insights

- **Parallel Processing** significantly reduced the execution time by leveraging all available CPU cores to process files concurrently.  
- A slight increase in memory usage was observed due to the overhead of task management, but this is outweighed by the efficiency gains.  

### Conclusion

Parallel processing is highly effective for tasks involving large datasets, such as analyzing file content in repositories. This optimization ensures better performance and scalability for the application.
